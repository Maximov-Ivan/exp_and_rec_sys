Photosynthesis is the biological process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. Utilizing sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, these organisms produce sugars (glucose) and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, forming the base of most food chains and maintaining the planet's atmospheric oxygen levels.
